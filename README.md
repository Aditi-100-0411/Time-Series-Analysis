Time Series Analysis of Global Stock Indices: Uncovering Market Dynamics. 

My methodology combines:  
Stationarity testing (ADF, KPSS, PP)  ,
DCC-GARCH for dynamic correlations, 
Granger causality for volatility transmission , 
Risk metrics (VaR, ES, Sharpe Ratio)

Visualizations including correlation plots and density distributions make complex relationships accessible, while a comprehensive CSV report summarizes key metrics. This end-to-end analysis demonstrates how advanced time series techniques can extract actionable intelligence from market data, supporting better investment decisions and risk management.

The project showcases professional-grade financial analytics using R's rugarch, vars, and ggplot2 packages, providing a template for analyzing any set of financial time series.
